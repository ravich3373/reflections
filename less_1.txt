How did viewing a diff between two versions of a 
file help you see the bug that was introduced?

there was no need for me to
go through every line and 
understand the code, any computer
program could be used 
to find the typos

How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

i can always look back at my oilder
 versions for the piece of code that 
 worked perfect without rewriting it

 What do you think are the pros and cons of manually 
 choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
 vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

 pros:
 cons:

 Why do you think some version control systems, 
 like Git, allow saving multiple files in 
 one commit, while others, like Google Docs, 
 treat each file separately?

 dont know,exactly but it may be because git is supposed to be
  working on projects and each file priority is supposed to be equal

  How can you use the commands git log and git diff to
   view the history of files?
  git log:shows the previous coomits and their id and  comments
  git diff:can be used to compare two commits using id's and get the additions and deletions.
git seems to be pretty useful,i can even it for my web
 dev and app dev obviously
